# Turtle Race Game

This is a fun turtle race game created using Python's `turtle` graphics module. Players can bet on the color of the turtle they believe will win the race. The game begins when a bet is placed, and the turtles race to the finish line. The player wins or loses based on whether their chosen turtle color matches the winner.

## Features
- Players can place a bet on a turtle color before the race starts.
- Six colorful turtles compete in the race.
- The winner is determined randomly based on turtle movement.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the color of the turtle you think will win the race.
3. Watch the turtles race to the finish line.
4. The game announces whether you guessed correctly or not.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- `turtle` module for graphics
- `random` module for unpredictable movements

## Setup and Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Run the script in an environment that supports the `turtle` graphics module (e.g., IDLE or a Python IDE).
